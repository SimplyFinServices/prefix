**<u>Why is compound interest important for savings?</u>**

Compound interest means that you earn money on your interest. If you put R100 in the bank and the interest rate is 10% you will have R110 at the end of the first year. You will have R121 at the end of the second year and you will earn more money every year if you don’t touch it.

1. You should not save for:
1. Your child’s education
2. Your groceries
3. A deposit for your house
4. Your old age

_Answer: B Groceries should be part of your budget for regular expenses._

1. You need your emergency savings when:
1. You want to have a party
2. Your child has to go to hospital
3. You want to go away for the weekend
4. You want the same new dress as your neighbour

_Answer: B An emergency is when something unexpected happens. Your car can break down, the geyser can burst, you might get sick.  The other items are luxuries._

1. You will get the best value from compound interest if you leave your money in the bank for:
1. One year
2. Five years
3. Twenty years
4. Fifteen years

_Answer: C The longer you leave your money in an interest bearing account the more compound interest it will attract and the higher your returns will be._

**<u>It is never too late to start saving</u>**

If you don’t have any savings it is never too late to start saving and it is important that you start now! Decide what you want to save for. It might be a car, your children’s education, a funeral, a deposit on a house, a holiday, your old age. Or simply because you like to be disciplined and watch your money grow!

Start small. Even R100 per month makes a difference if you stick to it. In fact, that means that in 5 years’ time you will have more than R6 000 in the bank!
